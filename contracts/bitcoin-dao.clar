;; Title: Implement Bitcoin-Based DAO Contract with Governance and Fund Management

;; Summary:
;; This commit introduces the Bitcoin-Based DAO Contract, implementing governance, voting, fund management, and investment tracking functionalities.
;; It includes delegation, investment returns, emergency controls, and governance parameters.

;; Description:
;; - Added error codes for various scenarios including authorization, voting, proposal status, fund management, delegation, emergency controls, and parameter validation.
;; - Defined data variables for DAO administration, quorum, voting period, proposal count, treasury balance, and emergency state.
;; - Established governance parameters including proposal fee, minimum and maximum proposal amounts, voting delay, voting period, timelock period, quorum threshold, and super-majority.
;; - Created data maps for members, proposals, votes, emergency admins, delegations, return pools, and member claims.
;; - Implemented emergency controls with functions to set emergency state and add emergency admins.
;; - Added functions for delegating votes, creating proposals, creating return pools, and claiming returns.
;; - Included governance parameter updates and helper functions for calculating member shares and validating parameters.
;; - Provided read-only functions to retrieve member info, proposal details, votes, delegations, return pools, claim status, emergency admin status, DAO parameters, and treasury balance.
