# Contributing to the DAO Smart Contract

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this DAO smart contract as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the style guidelines
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker]

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue]().

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Smart Contract Development Guidelines

1. **Security First**

   - Always consider potential attack vectors
   - Use proper access controls
   - Validate all inputs thoroughly

2. **Code Style**

   - Use clear and descriptive names
   - Comment complex logic
   - Keep functions focused and small

3. **Testing**

   - Write comprehensive tests
   - Include edge cases
   - Test failure scenarios

4. **Documentation**
   - Document all public functions
   - Include usage examples
   - Keep documentation up to date
